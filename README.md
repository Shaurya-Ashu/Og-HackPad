# Og-HackPad
Hello guys it's an Og HackPad for blueprint hack club . It controls the music and the vibe of the room it has three keyboard switches, 16 RGB LED and a volume controller with a small oled, displaying the name of the song .It's all controlled by XIAO R2040 the "BRAINS" and powered by US PC

# who am I?
Oh this is SHAURYA , I am a young inventor and passionate about cool robotic stuff so like I build multiple projects in my pass but not anything creative as cool as this one it's pretty damn cool. You know like RGB matrix flying up and down on with the song flow that's good.

--> The three switches are connected respectively to D10 D9 & D8 <br>
--> The rotary encoder is connected to D1 & D2 <br>
--> The old is connected to SCL & SDA respectively <br>
--> The RGB light is connected to D0 <br>

# PCB 
I have designed the PCB in KiCad
Finding all the models and footprint for a headache, but at last it's all done.

# CAD 
I have used fusion education for designing the case of my OgHackPack.
It went surprisingly well . It also has a stand so it could sit at 60° angle from the bench.
Here are some of the rendering from fusion and Blender.
